gyms.py — Gyms API Router

Handles all HTTP endpoints for Gym resources.
Gyms are the top-level tenant in the system — all other resources
(staff, members, sessions) belong to a gym via gym_id.

Route summary:
    POST   /gyms/           → register a new gym
    GET    /gyms/           → list all gyms in the system
    GET    /gyms/{gym_id}   → retrieve one gym by id
    PATCH  /gyms/{gym_id}   → partially update a gym
    DELETE /gyms/{gym_id}   → remove a gym and all its dependents

Error handling:
    ValueError from service layer → 400 Bad Request (duplicate)
    ValueError from service layer → 404 Not Found (gym does not exist)
