"""
members.py — Members API Router

Handles all HTTP endpoints for Member resources.
Members are tenant-scoped: every member belongs to a gym via gym_id.
Email must be unique per gym — two gyms can share an email,
but one gym cannot have two members with the same email.

Route summary:
    POST   /members/                → register a new member in a gym
    GET    /members/gyms/{gym_id}   → list all members belonging to a gym
    GET    /members/{member_id}     → retrieve one member by id
    PATCH  /members/{member_id}     → partially update a member
    DELETE /members/{member_id}     → remove a member

Error handling:
    ValueError from service layer → 400 Bad Request (duplicate or not found)
