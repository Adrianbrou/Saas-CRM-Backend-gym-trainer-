gym_service.py — Business Logic for Gym

The service layer sits between the API and the repository.
It enforces business rules before delegating to the repository.

FLOW:
  API receives request
    → calls service function
      → service checks business rules
        → service calls repository
          → repository talks to DB
            → result bubbles back up

def register_gym(db: Session, data: GymCreate) -> Gym:
    """Create a new gym after verifying the name is not already taken.

    WHY THIS EXISTS:
        The repository's create() would blindly save any Gym object you give it.
        It has no idea if a gym with that name already exists.
        The service enforces the business rule: gym names must be unique.

    HOW IT WORKS:
        1. Calls gym_repository.get_by_name() to check if the name exists.
        2. If found → raises ValueError. The API layer will catch this
           and return a 400 Bad Request to the client.
        3. If not found → builds a Gym SQLAlchemy object from the schema data
           using model_dump(), which converts the Pydantic object to a plain dict.
           The ** unpacks that dict into keyword arguments: Gym(name=..., location=...).
        4. Passes the new Gym object to gym_repository.create() to save it.

    Args:
        db: SQLAlchemy session injected by the caller (API route).
        data: Validated GymCreate schema containing name and location.

    Returns:
        The newly created Gym with its database-generated id and timestamps.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a gym with the same name already exists.

def update_gym(db: Session, gym_id: int, data: GymUpdate) -> Gym:
    """Update an existing gym's fields after verifying it exists.

    WHY THIS EXISTS:
        The repository's update() would silently return None if the gym
        doesn't exist. The service raises an explicit error instead,
        so the API can return a proper 404 Not Found to the client.

    HOW IT WORKS:
        1. Calls gym_repository.get_by_id() to verify the gym exists.
        2. If not found → raises ValueError.
        3. If found → calls model_dump(exclude_unset=True) on the schema.
           exclude_unset=True is critical: it only includes fields the client
           actually sent. If the client only sent {"location": "Toronto"},
           the dict will be {"location": "Toronto"} — NOT {"name": None, "location": "Toronto"}.
           Without this, you'd accidentally overwrite name with None.
        4. Passes gym_id and the updates dict to gym_repository.update().

    Args:
        db: SQLAlchemy session injected by the caller (API route).
        gym_id: Primary key of the gym to update.
        data: Validated GymUpdate schema — all fields optional.

    Returns:

        ValueError: If no gym with that id exists.
