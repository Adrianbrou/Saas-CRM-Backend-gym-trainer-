"""
staff.py — Staff API Router

Handles all HTTP endpoints for Staff resources.
Staff are tenant-scoped: every staff member belongs to a gym via gym_id.
Roles are restricted to RoleEnum values: 'manager' or 'trainer'.

Route summary:
    POST   /staff/              → register a new staff member in a gym
    GET    /staff/gym/{gym_id}  → list all staff belonging to a gym
    GET    /staff/{staff_id}    → retrieve one staff member by id
    PATCH  /staff/{staff_id}    → partially update a staff member
    DELETE /staff/{staff_id}    → remove a staff member

Error handling:
    ValueError from service layer → 400 Bad Request (duplicate, not found, etc.)
