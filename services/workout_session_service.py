"""
workout_session_service.py — Business Logic for WorkoutSession

This service manages three operations:
  1. create_session              — create a new workout session for a gym
  2. add_member_to_session       — register a member as attending a session
  3. remove_member_from_session  — remove a member from a session

KEY RULE: The trainer assigned to a session must belong to the same gym.
KEY RULE: The member added to a session must exist before adding attendance.

FLOW REMINDER:
  API → Service (business rules) → Repository (DB operations)
  The service never touches the DB directly.
